## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

To configure the project, you will first need to have Node and Docker installed on your computer.

Run the following command in the repository‚Äôs source code:

```bash
npm i
```

After that, you‚Äôll need to rename the `.env-example` file and fill in the environment variables according to your information.

## üöÄ Running

To run the project, first start the Qdrant container, which we‚Äôll use as a vector database:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Navigate to the `src/jobs` folder and open the `rag.ts` file. If you're using VSCode, you can use the debug run option "Launch current file", or you can run the file via the command line.

After this, our vector database will be set up.

To start our API, return to the root of the project and run `npm run dev`, or use the VSCode debug option "Start server".

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Design decisions

Due to limited time, I chose to use technologies I‚Äôm already familiar with, such as Qdrant for the vector database and OpenAI.

I separated the vector database population script into the `src/jobs` folder, which I usually reserve for scripts I run in batches or reuse frequently in my systems. In this case, we could schedule it using cron jobs to populate our vector database with updated information at specific times.

I generally use Qdrant because it's a high-performance vector database built in Rust. Since I‚Äôve worked with Rust, I feel confident it‚Äôs a reliable and stable choice.

I use OpenAI due to its comprehensive documentation, multi-language support, and the fact that it works well with Portuguese (which I typically use in my projects). However, in this case, I could experiment with other models like Anthropic or even use Amazon Bedrock to allow flexibility in choosing models.

I implemented the tool already integrated by Open AI to search for links provided by the user, I tested it a few times and it worked well, of course if I had more time I would have created a custom tool that would be a more robust way to deal with this type of situation, however my time was limited and this was a quick solution that I was able to implement.

## üÜô Improvements

Given more time, I could implement several improvements to this project. Here are a few:

* Better structure the RAG code to follow clean code principles, using classes.

* Implement a chat identification scheme to preserve each user‚Äôs previous messages.

* Summarize the user‚Äôs conversations if they become too long.

* Store the tokens and messages of each conversation.

* Improve the search for user-provided links by creating a custom tool and including it for the agent
